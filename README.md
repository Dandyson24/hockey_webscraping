# 🌐 Web Scraping Project: Sports Data Extraction & Analysis

This project demonstrates a practical web scraping workflow using **Python** to extract real-world sports data from the web for analytical purposes. The project is part of my data analytics learning journey under the **3MTT Nigeria program**, with special acknowledgment to **Alex Freberg** whose tutorials provided valuable guidance.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **BeautifulSoup (bs4)**
- **requests**
- **pandas**

## 📊 Project Overview
- Targeted and extracted structured data from ['https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/forms/'].
- Cleaned and transformed the data into a usable tabular format.
- Exported the dataset for further analysis and dashboard visualization.

## 📁 Project Files

- [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nWcCrfD3movOhX56chuSb_RInXN7guFe/view?usp=sharing] — Cleaned dataset ready for analysis

## 🚀 Next Steps & Recommendations
- Automate the scraping process to run at regular intervals (using **Python schedulers** or **Airflow**).
- Expand the scraping scope to multiple pages and dynamic websites (Selenium, Playwright).
- Integrate the scraped data into **Power BI** or **Tableau** for interactive dashboard visualizations.
- Perform trend analysis and predictive modeling for actionable insights.

## 🙌 Shout Outs
- **Alex Freberg** — For simplifying data projects through his tutorials.
- **3MTT Nigeria** — For providing the platform and resources to upskill in data analytics.
